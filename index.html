                <h3>PODCAST UTDI</h3>
                <p>my collaborative experience above is the utdi podcast that i did starting from july 11, 2024 until now it is still going on. i created the utdi podcast content with the utdi admissions team which was helped by several students majoring in information systems and informatics. when i first started making podcast videos because of an offer from the utdi admissions team who had the idea to create podcast content that required a lot of human resources so they recruited me. the problems i faced in making utdi podcast content include the difficulty of finding sources, the failure of technical devices and the availability of time in making podcast videos. some of the above difficulties such as difficulties in finding sources can be overcome due to the assistance of the rector of utdi and the hard work of the entire utdi podcast team. other difficulties such as the failure of technical devices have begun to be overcome by doing regular updates and checks before producing podcasts. thus the story of my experience may be a lot of shortcomings i apologize for that and thank you.</p>
